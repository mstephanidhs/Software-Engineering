## Software-Engineering ##

The goal is to implement a software development project on a smaller scale. In order for this to happen, our team needs to come to terms with the concept of planning, aka time scheduling, risk analysis etc. Afterwards, we will proceed to the phase of analysing the requirements of our project continuing with an initial and detailed design of it and eventually implement a small portion of the project by coding and make suggestions about testing it.
In every assignment our team delivers a specific amount of reports and whenever we update each report (making changes and adding new things to it), a new version will be created and added to the next assignment we have to deliver. The reports we are going to prepare are the below:

* Class Diagram
* Domain Model
* Feasibility Study
* Project Code
* Project Description
* Project Plan
* Risk Assessment
* Robustness Diagrams
* Sequence Diagrams
* Team Plan
* Team Risk Assessment
* Test Cases
* Uses Cases


## Main idea ##
Implement a software for a hospital using an object-oriented programming (OOP) language and more specifically Python (and PyQt5).
